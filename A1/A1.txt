Background
A Magic Square is an arrangement of numbers in square, so that every row, column, and diagonal add up to the
same value. Below are two squares, but only one of them is a Magic Square.

3 5 7
4 9 2

1 9 6
5 3 7
4 8 2

The square on the left is a 3 ¡Á 3 magic square, whose rows, columns, and diagonals all sum to 15. On the right, is a
3 ¡Á 3 square of numbers whose rows columns and diagonals don¡¯t have the same sum.
There are magic squares of all sizes, but we¡¯ll be concerned with 3¡Á3 squares, and checking if a given arrangement
of 9 numbers is a magic square or not.
Definition: A 3 ¡Á 3 magic square is formally defined by the following three criteria:
? It contains the integers 1 through 9 inclusively.
? Every integer in the range 1 through 9 appears exactly once.
? Every row, column, and diagonal sums to 15.

Task
In this assignment you will implement a program that does the following:
? It asks the user for a sequence of 9 numbers. The order of the numbers is important, as the rows of the grid
use this order.
? It checks whether the sequence of numbers is a magic square or not. Your program should display the message
¡°Yes!¡± if it¡¯s magic, or ¡°No!¡± if it¡¯s not.
It¡¯s very important to point out that you are not being asked to construct a magic square; only to check if a
square is magic or not.
